# MATLAB_Programmes
This repository contains my lab files for MATLAB codes. The files include MATLAB scripts, functions, and simulations that were created as part of my coursework.

Each lab file corresponds to a specific assignment or project and includes a brief description of the problem being solved, as well as any assumptions and limitations. The files are organized by lab session and cover a range of topics, including signal processing, control systems, and machine learning.

Overall, these lab files provide a comprehensive introduction to MATLAB and demonstrate its use in solving engineering and scientific problems. They are suitable for students and professionals interested in computational tools and numerical methods.
